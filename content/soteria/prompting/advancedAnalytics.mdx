## Backtest

A backtest is a test of a trading strategy on historical market data to see how it would preform in the past.
With backtesting, you are able to run it on different time periods, number of stocks, and volatility levels. Here are some examples:

- "Run a backtest on a low volatility strategy from jan 2024 to jan 2025, using a portfolio size of 50 stocks"
